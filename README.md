# stakingdao
We followed the steps that were illustrated in the lessons of Moonbean: DelegationDAO.sol and created a staking dao that helps users stake  the number of tokens that are less than the minimum requirement for staking.
However, they can pull together with other members to meet their minimum requirements for staking. 
We have created a simple mock UI that connects to Moonbean Network by Meta Mask address and performs the staking.
