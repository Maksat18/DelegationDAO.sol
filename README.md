# stakingdao
Followed by the lessons of Moonbean: DelegationDAO.sol 
We have created staking dao which helps user to stake  the amount of tokens which is less than minimum requirment for staking.
However, they can pull with other members to meet them minimum requirements of staking. 
We have ctreated simple mock UI which connect to Moonbean Network by Meta Mask address and perform the staking.
